1. Scan all .ssq files in a directory
2. calculate the groove radar values for each difficulty (both SP and DP)
3. and then export it to values.csv

NOTE: This script is primarily for .ssq files used in DDR A and later. The .ssq file type is very old and has been used since DDR 4thMIX, and older .ssq files are untested so they may not fully work with this script.
